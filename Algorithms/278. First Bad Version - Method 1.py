# You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. 
# Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. 
# Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

# Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

# You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. 
# Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.


# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:

    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        start = 1
        end = n

        while start <= end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            if isBadVersion(mid) == True:
