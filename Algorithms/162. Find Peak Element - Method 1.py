# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.


class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        right = len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            mid1 = (left+right) // 2
            mid2 = mid1 + 1
            if nums[mid1] < nums[mid2]:
                left = mid2
            else:
                right = mid1
